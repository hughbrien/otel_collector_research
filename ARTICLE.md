# Ideas about Open Telemetry 

There are large number of configuration considerations when configuring a collector. To start,  there is the overall configuration based on the location and context :

- Services
- Receivers
- Processors
- Exporters
- Extensions
- Connectors


### What all APM (pre-Observabiltiy) Vendors did prior to the present was to make assumptions about their agents they created.

### The agents could be built with different assumptions :

- AppDynamics : the Java Agent default configuration was deployed to be RUN IN PRODUCTION
- Wily Technology : there were several agents
- New Relic Agent : Generic Agent that could run anywhere.  Might need basic tuning to run in Production


### Agents were designed with specific assuptions and deployed with a default configuration.

Design considerations for early agents were :
- Sampling vs No-Sampleing : This includes Metric collection as well a Trace/Span Collection.
- Instrumentation : Automatics vs manual
- How often are measurments taken?
- How many measruments are are taken?
- How is the data packaged and delivered

### All of these consideratiosn dictated the OVERHEAD of the agent. Most agents could be tuned.
- Some agents has different machanism for data collection.
- For example early agents could periodcaiily would enable a Profiler.
- Other agents would isntrument specific  methieds on the call stack.
- Other agents would instrument every method in a call stack.

### All of the configuration consideratiosn of an OpenTelemetry Collector need to be considered

Does your collector work to a single purpose or multiple.
- a single host for virtual machine
- A database monitor that is able to monitor 1 or Many databases.  
- Here you consider whethor not you want to scale very large

## Develop

Configuring an OpenTelemetry Collector to suit specific monitoring needs can be a complex process, given the broad spectrum of scalability, performance requirements, and the vast array of available components. The size and scale of the deployment significantly influence configuration choices, as larger-scale deployments necessitate more thoughtful planning around resource allocation, data throughput, and redundancy to ensure reliability and efficiency.

Moreover, the OpenTelemetry ecosystem offers a wide range of receivers, exporters, and processors, each designed to cater to different sources of telemetry data, destinations for data export, and data processing needs. This variety enables highly customizable setups but also introduces complexity due to the large number of possible permutations.

Architects and developers must carefully select and configure these components to create a harmonious and scalable observability framework that aligns with their system's architecture and their organization's observability goals.

The challenge lies in balancing the flexibility offered by the OpenTelemetry Collector with the simplicity needed for maintainable and efficient observability solutions.
